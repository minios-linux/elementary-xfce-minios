Description: elementary icon theme modified for Xfce
 elementary-xfce is a fork of the elementary OS icon theme for Xfce and other
 desktops.
 .
 This fork took place because the elementary OS maintainers wanted to focus
 exclusively on their desktop environment and thus dropped a lot of icon
 symlinks used by other desktops. elementary-xfce intends to keep these as-is,
 while still pulling in new icons and integrating them occasionally.
